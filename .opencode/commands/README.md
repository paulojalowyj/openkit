## How to Use

### 1. With Arguments (Direct)
```bash
/plan create JWT auth system
/engineer build e-commerce with Stripe checkout
```

### 2. Without Arguments (Interactive)
```bash
/plan
→ (via question tool) "What would you like to plan?"
→ You describe it
→ System executes
```

### 3. Full Flow
```bash
# 1. Specify
/specify add dark mode feature
→ Creates docs/requirements/<feature>/
→ STOP: "Proceed to clarify or plan?"

# 2. Clarify
/clarify
→ Resolves ambiguities in spec
→ STOP: "Proceed to plan?"

# 3. Plan
/plan add dark mode feature
→ Creates plan + auxiliary artifacts when applicable
→ STOP: "Review and confirm?"

# 4. Tasks
/tasks
→ Generates docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/TASKS.md
→ STOP: "Proceed to implement?"

# 5. Implement (after approval)
/impl from docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/TASKS.md
→ Executes plan tasks
→ STOP between phases (P0→P1→P2→P3)

# 6. Analyze + Checklist
/analyze
→ Validates spec/plan/tasks consistency
/checklist
→ Confirms readiness and gaps

# 7. Test
/test all
→ Runs all checks
→ Reports results

# 8. Deploy (if approved)
/deploy production
→ Pre-deploy checklist
→ STOP: "Confirm production deploy?"
→ Executes deploy
→ Post-deploy verification
```

## Hybrid Behavior

All commands follow a hybrid behavior:

1. **Show:** Load and explain the appropriate command protocol
2. **Ask (via question tool):** Mandatory STOP points for approval
3. **Execute:** Only after user confirmation

---

## STOP Points

The system always pauses for approval at critical moments:

### `/plan`
> "Plan recorded in `docs/requirements/` and `docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/`. Review and confirm to proceed?"

### `/impl`
- Between each phase (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- At the end: "Run final verification?"

### `/deploy`
- Production requires explicit confirmation
- After deploy: "Confirm success?"

## Command Features

### Placeholders
- `$ARGUMENTS` - All user arguments
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3` - Positional arguments

### Shell Integration
- `!command` - Inject shell output
- Example: `!git log --oneline -10`

### File References
- `@file` - Include file content
- Example: `@src/components/Button.tsx`

---

## Configuration

### Local (This Project)
Files in `.opencode/commands/` are available only in this project.

### Global (All Projects)
Copy to `~/.config/opencode/commands/` to use everywhere:

```bash
cp -r .opencode/commands/* ~/.config/opencode/commands/
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature
```bash
# Plan
/plan add dark mode toggle
→ Updates docs artifacts

# Approve and implement
/impl from docs/sprint/Sprint-XX/TASKS.md
→ Executes tasks

# Test
/test coverage
→ 95% coverage, all passing
```

### Example 2: Complex System
```bash
# Orchestrate everything
/engineer build e-commerce with Stripe
→ Phase 1: Planning (project-planner)
→ STOP: "Proceed?"
→ Phase 2: Implementation (multiple agents)
→ STOP: "Verify?"
→ Phase 3: Verification (Phase X)
→ Project complete! 
```

### Example 3: Debug
```bash
/debug users can't login after last update
→ Phase 1: Symptom Analysis
→ Phase 2: Information Gathering
→ Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing
→ Phase 4: Resolution
→ Bug fixed! 
```

## Tips

1. **Use `/engineer` for complex tasks** - It coordinates multiple agents
2. **Use `/plan` first** - Always plan before implementing
3. **Do not skip STOPs** - Manual approvals ensure quality
4. **Keep plans small** - If > 10 tasks, split into parts
5. **Run `/test` often** - Catch issues early

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Command does not appear after typing /"
→ Restart the OpenCode TUI

### "Command not found"
→ Verify that `.opencode/commands/` exists

### "Python scripts do not run"
→ Ensure Python is installed and dependencies are satisfied

---

## OpenKit Integration

These commands reuse:
-  Specialist prompts (`.opencode/prompts/`)
-  Skills (`.opencode/skills/`)
-  Python validation scripts (`.opencode/scripts/`)
-  Original rules and protocols

They are only adapted to the OpenCode command format.

## Ready to use!

Open the OpenCode TUI and type `/` to see all available commands.
