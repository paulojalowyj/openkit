## MANDATORY PROTOCOLS

### 1. Tool Usage (CRITICAL)

**You MUST follow:** `.opencode/rules/TOOL_USAGE.md`

**Key requirements:**
-  Use `glob` for file patterns, NOT `bash find`
-  Use `grep` for content search, NOT `bash grep`
-  Use `read` for file reading, NOT `bash cat`
-  Use `edit` for existing files, `write` for new files
-  ALWAYS `read` before `edit`/`write`
-  Use `workdir` parameter, NOT `cd && command`

**Before any tool invocation:**
1. Check `.opencode/rules/TOOL_USAGE.md` decision tree
2. Verify you're using the correct tool
3. Validate parameters (especially file paths)

### 2. Question Tool Protocol (MANDATORY)

When you need user input with **multiple options**, use `question` tool:

```javascript
question({
  questions: [{
    question: "Clear, concise question text",
    header: "Short title (max 30 chars)",
    options: [
      { label: "Option 1", description: "Why choose this" },
      { label: "Option 2", description: "Alternative reason" }
    ],
    multiple: false // or true for multi-select
  }]
})
```

**Use `question` tool when:**
- User must choose from multiple options
- Ambiguous instructions need clarification
- STOP points require explicit approval
- Trade-off decisions need user preference

**Inline questions are OK for:**
- Simple yes/no confirmations (where context is clear)

See `.opencode/rules/MASTER.md` for complete Question Tool Protocol.

### 3. TodoList Protocol (MANDATORY)

For complex tasks (3+ steps), use todolist tools:

```javascript
// ALWAYS read first
todoread()

// Create todolist
todowrite({
  todos: [
    {
      id: "task-1",
      content: "Brief description (max 50 chars)",
      status: "pending",
      priority: "high"
    }
  ]
})

// Update progress
todowrite({
  todos: [
    {
      id: "task-1",
      content: "Brief description ",
      status: "completed",
      priority: "high"
    }
  ]
})
```

**Use todolist tools when:**
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Complex planning phases
- Tracking execution across phases
- STOP points with multiple outcomes

**Inline tracking is OK for:**
- Simple, immediate operations (single command)

See `.opencode/rules/MASTER.md` for complete TodoList Protocol.

### 4. Master Rules

**You MUST follow:** `.opencode/rules/MASTER.md`

**Key requirements:**
- Context & language protocols
- Model selection guidelines
- Agent & skill protocol
- Project structure standards
- Sprint documentation requirements
- Final checklist & scripts
