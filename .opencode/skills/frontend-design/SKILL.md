# Frontend Design System

> **Philosophy:** Every pixel has purpose. Restraint is luxury. User psychology drives decisions.
> **Core Principle:** THINK, don't memorize. ASK, don't assume.

---

## Selective Reading Rule (MANDATORY)

**Read REQUIRED files always, OPTIONAL only when needed:**

| File | Status | When to Read |
|------|--------|--------------|
| [ux-psychology.md](ux-psychology.md) |  **REQUIRED** | Always read first! |
| [color-system.md](color-system.md) |  Optional | Color/palette decisions |
| [typography-system.md](typography-system.md) |  Optional | Font selection/pairing |
| [visual-effects.md](visual-effects.md) |  Optional | Glassmorphism, shadows, gradients |
| [animation-guide.md](animation-guide.md) |  Optional | Animation needed |
| [motion-graphics.md](motion-graphics.md) |  Optional | Lottie, GSAP, 3D |
| [decision-trees.md](decision-trees.md) |  Optional | Context templates |

>  **ux-psychology.md = ALWAYS READ. Others = only if relevant.**

---

## Question Tool Usage (MANDATORY)

When this skill requires user input or choices:
- Use `question` tool for all multi-option scenarios
- Present design options with clear descriptions
- Structure preference questions properly

**Example usage:**
```javascript
question({
  questions: [{
      question: "Which design style?",
      header: "Style",
      options: [
        { label: "Minimal", description: "Clean, simple" },
        { label: "Glassmorphism", description: "Modern, depth" },
        { label: "Neon", description: "Bold, vibrant" }
      ]
    }]
})
```

See `.opencode/rules/MASTER.md` for complete Question Tool Protocol.

---

## Runtime Scripts

**Execute these for audits (don't read, just run):**

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/ux_audit.py` | UX Psychology & Accessibility Audit | `python scripts/ux_audit.py <project_path>` |
| `scripts/design_system.py` | Design System Engine (Colors/Typo) | `python scripts/design_system.py --help` |
| `scripts/search.py` | Semantic Design Search | `python scripts/search.py "query"` |

---

## CRITICAL: ASK BEFORE ASSUMING (MANDATORY)

> **STOP! If the user's request is open-ended, DO NOT default to your favorites.**

### When User Prompt is Vague, ASK:

**Color not specified?** Ask:
> "What color palette do you prefer? (blue/green/orange/neutral/other?)"

**Style not specified?** Ask: 
> "What style are you going for? (minimal/bold/retro/futuristic/organic?)"

**Layout not specified?** Ask:
> "Do you have a layout preference? (single column/grid/asymmetric/full-width?)"

### DEFAULT TENDENCIES TO BE AWARE OF:

| AI Default Tendency | Why It's a Concern | Better Approach |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Bento Grids Everywhere** | Used in every AI design | Why does this content NEED a grid? Use when appropriate |
| **Always Hero Split** | Default to familiar pattern | Consider alternatives when they serve the content better |
| **Mesh/Aurora Gradients** | The "new" lazy background | Use intentionally, not as default |
| **Glassmorphism** | AI's idea of "premium" | Use when it enhances the design, not by default |
| **Generic Colors** | Default blue/cyan/purple | Choose colors based on brand and emotion |
| **Generic Copy** | AI-generated buzzwords | Write authentic copy that reflects the brand voice |
| Dark background + neon glow | Overused "AI look" | Use when it matches the brand personality |
| **Rounded everything** | Generic/Safe | Choose edge treatment based on brand personality |

>  **Default patterns aren't inherently bad - they become problems when used without thinking. Consider context and make intentional choices.**

---

## 1. Constraint Analysis (ALWAYS FIRST)

Before any design work, ANSWER THESE or ASK USER:

| Constraint | Question | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Timeline** | How much time? | Determines complexity |
| **Content** | Ready or placeholder? | Affects layout flexibility |
| **Brand** | Existing guidelines? | May dictate colors/fonts |
| **Tech** | What stack? | Affects capabilities |
| **Audience** | Who exactly? | Drives all visual decisions |

### Audience → Design Approach

| Audience | Think About |
|----------|-------------|
| **Gen Z** | Bold, fast, mobile-first, authentic |
| **Millennials** | Clean, minimal, value-driven |
| **Gen X** | Familiar, trustworthy, clear |
| **Boomers** | Readable, high contrast, simple |
| **B2B** | Professional, data-focused, trust |
| **Luxury** | Restrained elegance, whitespace |

---

## 2. UX Psychology Principles

### Core Laws (Internalize These)

| Law | Principle | Application |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **Hick's Law** | More choices = slower decisions | Limit options, use progressive disclosure |
| **Fitts' Law** | Bigger + closer = easier to click | Size CTAs appropriately |
| **Miller's Law** | ~7 items in working memory | Chunk content into groups |
| **Von Restorff** | Different = memorable | Make CTAs visually distinct |
| **Serial Position** | First/last remembered most | Key info at start/end |

### Emotional Design Levels

```
VISCERAL (instant)  → First impression: colors, imagery, overall feel
BEHAVIORAL (use)    → Using it: speed, feedback, efficiency
REFLECTIVE (memory) → After: "I like what this says about me"
```

### Trust Building

- Security indicators on sensitive actions
- Social proof where relevant
- Clear contact/support access
- Consistent, professional design
- Transparent policies

---

## 3. Layout Principles

### Golden Ratio (φ = 1.618)

```
Use for proportional harmony:
├── Content : Sidebar = roughly 62% : 38%
├── Each heading size = previous × 1.618 (for dramatic scale)
├── Spacing can follow: sm → md → lg (each × 1.618)
```

### 8-Point Grid Concept

```
All spacing and sizing in multiples of 8:
├── Tight: 4px (half-step for micro)
├── Small: 8px
├── Medium: 16px
├── Large: 24px, 32px
├── XL: 48px, 64px, 80px
└── Adjust based on content density
```

### Key Sizing Principles

| Element | Consideration |
|---------|---------------|
| **Touch targets** | Minimum comfortable tap size |
| **Buttons** | Height based on importance hierarchy |
| **Inputs** | Match button height for alignment |
| **Cards** | Consistent padding, breathable |
| **Reading width** | 45-75 characters optimal |

---

## 4. Color Principles

### 60-30-10 Rule

```
60% → Primary/Background (calm, neutral base)
30% → Secondary (supporting areas)
10% → Accent (CTAs, highlights, attention)
```

### Color Psychology (For Decision Making)

| If You Need... | Consider Hues | Avoid |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Trust, calm | Blue family | Aggressive reds |
| Growth, nature | Green family | Industrial grays |
| Energy, urgency | Orange, red | Passive blues |
| Luxury, creativity | Deep Teal, Gold, Emerald | Cheap-feeling brights |
| Clean, minimal | Neutrals | Overwhelming color |

### Selection Process

1. **What's the industry?** (narrows options)
2. **What's the emotion?** (picks primary)
3. **Light or dark mode?** (sets foundation)
4. **ASK USER** if not specified

## 5. Typography Principles

### Scale Selection

| Content Type | Scale Ratio | Feel |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| Dense UI | 1.125-1.2 | Compact, efficient |
| General web | 1.25 | Balanced (most common) |
| Editorial | 1.333 | Readable, spacious |
| Hero/display | 1.5-1.618 | Dramatic impact |

### Pairing Concept

```
Contrast + Harmony:
├── DIFFERENT enough for hierarchy
├── SIMILAR enough for cohesion
└── Usually: display + neutral, or serif + sans
```

### Readability Rules

- **Line length**: 45-75 characters optimal
- **Line height**: 1.4-1.6 for body text
- **Contrast**: Check WCAG requirements
- **Size**: 16px+ for body on web

## 6. Visual Effects Principles

### Glassmorphism (When Appropriate)

```
Key properties:
├── Semi-transparent background
├── Backdrop blur
├── Subtle border for definition
└──  **WARNING:** Standard blue/white glassmorphism is a modern cliché. Use it radically or not at all.
```

### Shadow Hierarchy

```
Elevation concept:
├── Higher elements = larger shadows
├── Y-offset > X-offset (light from above)
├── Multiple layers = more realistic
└── Dark mode: may need glow instead
```

### Gradient Usage

```
Harmonious gradients:
├── Adjacent colors on wheel (analogous)
├── OR same hue, different lightness
├── Avoid harsh complementary pairs
├──  **NO Mesh/Aurora Gradients** (floating blobs)
└── VARY from project to project radically
```

For complete effects guide: [visual-effects.md](visual-effects.md)

---

## 7. Animation Principles

### Timing Concept

```
Duration based on:
├── Distance (further = longer)
├── Size (larger = slower)
├── Importance (critical = clear)
└── Context (urgent = fast, luxury = slow)
```

### Easing Selection

| Action | Easing | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Entering | Ease-out | Decelerate, settle in |
| Leaving | Ease-in | Accelerate, exit |
| Emphasis | Ease-in-out | Smooth, deliberate |
| Playful | Bounce | Fun, energetic |

### Performance

- Animate only transform and opacity
- Respect reduced-motion preference
- Test on low-end devices

## 8. "Wow Factor" Checklist

### Premium Indicators

- [ ] Generous whitespace (luxury = breathing room)
- [ ] Subtle depth and dimension
- [ ] Smooth, purposeful animations
- [ ] Attention to detail (alignment, consistency)
- [ ] Cohesive visual rhythm
- [ ] Custom elements (not all defaults)

### Trust Builders

- [ ] Security cues where appropriate
- [ ] Social proof / testimonials
- [ ] Clear value proposition
- [ ] Professional imagery
- [ ] Consistent design language

### Emotional Triggers

- [ ] Hero that evokes intended emotion
- [ ] Human elements (faces, stories)
- [ ] Progress/achievement indicators
- [ ] Moments of delight

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### Lazy Design Indicators

- Default system fonts without consideration
- Stock imagery that doesn't match
- Inconsistent spacing
- Too many competing colors
- Walls of text without hierarchy
- Inaccessible contrast

### AI Tendency Patterns (BE AWARE!)

- **Same colors every project** → Choose based on brand and context
- **Dark + neon as default** → Use when it fits the brand personality
- **Generic color choices** → Consider what works for the specific brand/industry
- **Bento grids for simple landing pages** → Use when they serve the content, not by default
- **Mesh Gradients & Glow Effects** → Apply intentionally, not as background default
- **Same layout structure / Vercel clone** → Consider alternatives, but use patterns that work
- **Not asking user preferences** → Always involve the user in design decisions

### Dark Patterns (Unethical)

- Hidden costs
- Fake urgency
- Forced actions
- Deceptive UI
- Confirmshaming

## 10. Decision Process Summary

```
For EVERY design task:

1. CONSTRAINTS
   └── What's the timeline, brand, tech, audience?
   └── If unclear → ASK

2. CONTENT
   └── What content exists?
   └── What's the hierarchy?

3. STYLE DIRECTION
   └── What's appropriate for context?
   └── If unclear → ASK (don't default!)

4. EXECUTION
   └── Apply principles above
   └── Check against anti-patterns

5. REVIEW
   └── "Does this serve the user?"
   └── "Is this different from my defaults?"
   └── "Would I be proud of this?"
```
